// not. Idempotent, and safe from the moment begin() has brought I2C up — which
// matters, because the two early returns in setup() reach deep sleep before the
// display driver has run prepareEpdPower() even once.
//
// Why this exists as its own entry point rather than being left to the driver:
// the PCA9535 sits on a rail that never goes down, so its output latches survive
// the ESP's deep sleep AND the wake reset. Whatever the last session left in
// them is what the board sleeps with. A TPS65185 left awake there costs tens of
// milliamps for as long as the sleep lasts, and nothing in the log can see it —
// the panel is re-initialised on the next boot, so the awake current reads
// completely normal afterwards.
//
// Returns true when the expander read back the parked state.

// console and no card, so this is the only way the next boot can say what the
